# CrowdRec
Have you ever been unpleasantly surprised by the predictability of music recommendations? I love music, and I have been on almost every music source online under the sun looking for recommendations. After a while, I found that my recommendations on sites like Spotify were too predictable and reactive, giving me almost the same artists and genre every week. I created CrowdRec to provide recommendations based only on *what others put in playlists*. The application was hastily built using React and the spotify-web-api-js wrapper for Spotify's API.
